# **Must-haves for every build**

## **1) Repo hygiene & packaging**

* **Clear README** with “What it does / Quick start / Config / Limits / FAQ”.
* **LICENSE** (MIT or Apache-2.0 unless you need copyleft). Don’t skip a license—many orgs won’t touch repos without one.**  **
* **Semantic versioning** for tags/releases (v0.1.0 etc.).**  **
* **CHANGELOG.md** following “Keep a Changelog” so users can see what changed per release.**  **
* **Packaging**: a minimal container image (Dockerfile + .dockerignore) so others can run it the same way you do; follow official image best-practices (multi-stage, pin bases, lean layers).**  **
* **.gitignore + .gitattributes** tuned for Python/Node/etc.

## **2) Config & secrets (12-Factor)**

* **No secrets in repo.** Use **env vars** and provide **.env.example** (no real values). This is the clean, portable pattern.**  **
* Document each env var in README (type, required, default).
* If needed, support **.env** loading locally but prefer real envs in CI.

## **3) Usage DX (developer experience)**

* **Makefile** (or **justfile**) with the 5 commands people need:
  * **make setup** (install deps)
  * **make run** (run scraper locally)
  * make test
  * make lint
  * **make build** (container)
* **One-shot run**: **docker run …** or **make run** should work with only **.env** filled.
* **Sample data**: include tiny inputs (e.g., 3 example URLs) for a first-run success.

## **4) Quality gates & CI**

* **Pre-commit hooks** (black/ruff, isort, bandit; or equivalents) so every commit is clean.**  **
* **Tests**: at least smoke tests for the request layer, parsing utilities, and DB layer.
* **CI** (GitHub Actions): run lint + tests + docker build on PRs.

## **5) Reliability (scraper-specific)**

* **Retry with exponential backoff** on transient HTTP errors (429/5xx), honoring **Retry-After** when present.**  **
* **Rate limiting & pacing** (global and per-domain caps). If a site exposes **Crawl-Delay** or guidance, respect it.**  **
* **Politeness & robots**: fetch and respect **robots.txt** rules as a baseline; understand that implementations vary and rules can be interpreted differently—err on the side of being conservative.**  **
* **Time-boxed runs** with graceful shutdown (so CI/CD doesn’t hang).
* **Idempotent writes** (e.g., upsert by website) to avoid duplicate rows.

## **6) Observability**

* **Structured logging** (JSON or key=value) with correlation IDs per job.
* **Metrics**: requests made, success rate, 4xx/5xx counts, retry counts, average latency, rows written.
* **Error reporting**: clear exit codes; optional Sentry/Honeycomb hooks later.

## **7) Data model & storage**

* **Schema doc** in README (field name, type, example, how derived).
* **Normalization rules** (e.g., lowercase emails, canonicalize URLs).
* **Provenance**: store **source\_page** and **collected\_at** for every row (you already planned this—good).

## **8) Distribution & releases**

* **Versioned containers** (**:0.1.0**, **:latest**) and GitHub releases with artifacts.
* **Quickstart section** showing both:
  * **Local: **python -m app …** or **make run
  * **Container: **docker run --env-file .env ghcr.io/you/prospect-seeder:0.1.0
* **Compatibility**: state minimum Python/Node and OS.

## **9) Community & governance (even if solo)**

* **CONTRIBUTING.md** (how to run tests, standards).
* **CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md** (GitHub provides templates and “community health” files).**  **

## **10) Legal, ethics, and scope**

* **Respect site policies** and **robots.txt** (document your stance).**  **
* **Public data only**; never authenticate or bypass controls in this project.
* **PII caution**: avoid storing sensitive personal data; document what you collect and why.

# **Pre-flight checklist for** ****

# **Prospect\_Data\_Seeder**

Put these in **/Build** so it’s shippable to GitHub without secrets:

```
Build/
  README.md                  # what it does, quick start, .env keys, limits
  LICENSE
  CHANGELOG.md
  CONTRIBUTING.md
  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
  .gitignore
  .dockerignore
  .pre-commit-config.yaml
  Dockerfile
  Makefile
  .env.example               # example keys only
  sample/
    sample_urls.txt
  src/
    app/                     # your code
    tests/                   # smoke tests
```

**README sections to include**

1. Summary and scope
2. Quickstart (local and Docker)
3. Configuration table (env vars)
4. Data schema (fields you listed)
5. Limits and politeness policy (robots, rate limits)**  **
6. Troubleshooting (common HTTP errors, retries/backoff)**  **
7. License and acknowledgments (SemVer + Changelog)**  **

# **Why these choices**

* **Env-var config** keeps secrets out of the repo and makes packaging portable.**  **
* **Docker best practices** ensure predictable runs for anyone pulling your image.**  **
* **SemVer + Changelog** make upgrades safe for users.**  **
* **Polite crawling** and **robots awareness** protect you and build trust.**  **
* **Pre-commit** keeps quality high without manual nagging.**  **


Great question. Here’s what each file/folder in your **Build/** scaffold is for—and why it matters when you want something packageable, robust, and easy for others to use.

## **Top-level docs**

* **README.md**
  The “front door.” Explains what the project does, how to run it (local + Docker), what env vars to set, data schema, limits, and troubleshooting. This is the single most important file for adoption.
* **LICENSE**
  Tells others what they’re legally allowed to do (use, modify, distribute). Without a license, many orgs won’t touch the repo. Choose a permissive license (MIT/Apache-2.0) unless you need copyleft.
* **CHANGELOG.md**
  Human-readable history of changes per release (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed). Follow the “Keep a Changelog” format so upgrades are predictable.**  **
* **CONTRIBUTING.md**
  How to contribute: branch/PR style, tests, coding style, commit hooks, issue templates. GitHub treats this (and other “community health” files) specially to encourage healthy contributions.**  **
* **CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md**
  Sets expectations for behavior in issues/PRs and how to report problems. Another GitHub “community health” file that improves contributor trust.**  **

## **Ignore lists & automation**

* **.gitignore**
  Tells Git which files to *not* track (e.g., **.env**, caches, build artifacts). Prevents accidental commits of secrets and clutter.**  **
* **.dockerignore**
  Tells Docker which files to exclude from the build context (node\_modules, test fixtures, large junk). Faster, smaller, safer images.**  **
* **.pre-commit-config.yaml**
  Defines commit hooks (formatters/linters/secret scanners) that run *before* a commit lands. Ensures consistent quality without policing PRs. Managed by the **pre-commit** framework.**  **

## **Build & run**

* **Dockerfile**
  Reproducible runtime: anyone can run the exact same environment. Follow official best practices (multi-stage builds, pin base image, keep images small).**  **
* **Makefile**
  One-liners for common tasks so usage is the same on every machine/CI. Typical targets:
  * **make setup** (install deps)
  * **make run** (run with your **.env**)
  * **make test** (unit/smoke tests)
  * **make lint** (format/lint)
  * **make build** (build container)

## **Configuration & samples**

* **.env.example**
  Template of required env vars (no secrets). Users copy to **.env** and fill in values. This follows Twelve-Factor’s guidance to keep config in the environment (portable and safer).**  **
* **sample/**
  Tiny inputs for a first successful run (e.g., **sample\_urls.txt**). Removes friction so someone can prove the tool works in under a minute.

## **Source & tests**

* **src/**
  Your code. Keep it modular (e.g., **app/http.py**, **app/parse.py**, **app/db.py**) so it’s easy to test and swap parts.
* **tests/**
  Smoke and unit tests (e.g., parse a known page fixture; simulate transient HTTP errors; verify DB upsert). CI will run these on every PR so the build stays healthy.

## **Why these are “must-haves”**

* **Versioning & releases:** Tag releases with **SemVer** (v0.1.0 → v0.2.0) so users can trust upgrades and breaking changes are signaled.**  **
* **Config in env:** Keeps secrets out of Git and makes the app portable across machines/CI/cloud.**  **
* **Docker + .dockerignore:** Ensures consistent runtime and smaller, faster builds.**  **
* **Pre-commit hooks:** Automate formatting and basic checks; fewer “nit” comments in PRs.**  **
* **Changelog & health files:** Make the repo safe and predictable for outside users/companies.**  **
